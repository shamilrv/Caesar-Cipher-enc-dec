# Caesar-Cipher-enc-dec
How the Program Works 
1.Encryption and Decryption:
The program uses the Caesar Cipher algorithm, which shifts each letter in the text by the number specified in the shift value. For encryption, the letters are shifted forward, and for decryption, they are shifted backward.

2.Input Validation:
The program allows a shift value between 1 and 25, which ensures that the alphabet is rotated properly without repeating the original position.

3.Handling Non-Letter Characters:
Characters that are not letters (such as spaces, punctuation, numbers) are left unchanged.
